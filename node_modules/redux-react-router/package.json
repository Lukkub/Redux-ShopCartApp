This abstraction is super useful for route matching and rendering, but the API for interacting with the router to 1) trigger transitions and 2) react to state changes within the component lifecycle leaves something to be desired. The official recommendations include a collection of [mixins](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/master/doc/04%20Mixins) and accessing the router on the context object, neither of which are very appealing.\n\nIt turns out we already solved these problems with Flux (and Redux): We use action creators to trigger state changes, and we use higher-order components to subscribe to state changes.\n\nThis library allows you to keep your router state **inside your Redux store**. So getting the current pathname, query, and params is as easy as selecting any other part of your application state:\n\n```js\n// Current location: /search?q=redux\n<Connector select={state => ({ q: state.router.query.q })}>\n  {props => <SearchBox q={props.q} />}\n</Connector>\n```\n\nThere are also (optional) action creators that will trigger route changes:\n\n```js\ndispatch(transitionTo('/search', { q: 'redux' }));\ndispatch(replaceWith('/search', { q: 'redux' }));\n// Or after using bindActionCreators() or equivalent\ntransitionTo('/search', { q: 'redux' });\nreplaceWith('/search', { q: 'redux' });\n```\n\n### Works with Redux Devtools (and other external state changes)\n\nredux-react-router will notice if the router state in your Redux store changes from an external source other than the router itself — e.g. the Redux Devtools — and trigger a transition accordingly!\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, add a new Route to your route configuration that wraps around all the other routes:\n\n```js\nimport { reduxRouteComponent } from 'redux-react-router';\nconst RouteComponent = reduxRouteComponent(store);\n\n<Router history={history}>\n  <Route component={RouteComponent}>\n    <Route path=\"/\" component={App}>\n      <Route path=\"/foo\" component={Foo} />\n      <Route path=\"/bar\" component={Bar} />\n    </Route>\n  </Route>\n</Router>\n```\n\n`reduxRouteComponent()` creates a component that you pass to `<Route />`. This sets up your store to listen to route transitions.\n\n**NOTE:** This probably isn't the ideal API I'd create from scratch, but I'm working within the limits of React Router's current API.\n\nThis will also add your to context, replacing the need to use a `<Provider />`.\n\n**NOTE:** React 0.13 and below use owner-based context. Long story short, you'll still need to use a `<Provider />` until React 0.14 is out of beta. Until then, you also won't be able to use the `transitionTo()` action creator. The normal React Router API for transitions will continue to work, however, as will state updates.\n\nNext, configure your reducer to respond to route transitions:\n\n```js\nimport { routerStateReducer } from 'redux-react-router';\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  router: routerStateReducer,\n  ...otherReducers\n})\n```\n\nThe router state should be stored at `state.router` in order to properly detect state changes. A helpful warning will be printed to the console if the reducer is improperly configured.\n\n## API\n\n### `reduxRouteComponent(store)`\n\nCreates a component to be passed to `<Route component={component} />`. The `<Route />` should wrap all the other routes.\n\n### `routerStateReducer(state, action)`\n\nA reducer that keeps track of Router state. Be sure it's configured such that the router state is located on the main state object at `state.router`. This is simple using `combineReducers()` — see the example in the Usage section above.\n\n### `transitionTo(pathname, query, state)`\n\nAn action creator that works like [`router.transitionTo()`](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/doc/04%20Mixins/Navigation.md#transitionto).\n\n### `replaceWith(pathname, query, state)`\n\nAn action creator that works like [`router.replaceWith()`](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/doc/04%20Mixins/Navigation.md#replacewith).\n\n## Bonus: Reacting to state changes with redux-rx\n\nThis library pairs well with [redux-rx](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-rx) to trigger route transitions in response to state changes. Here's a simple example of redirecting to a new page after a successful login:\n\n```js\nconst LoginPage = createConnector(props$, state$, dispatch$, () => {\n  const actionCreators$ = bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch$);\n  const transitionTo$ = actionCreators$.map(ac => ac.transitionTo);\n\n  // Detect logins\n  const didLogin$ = state$\n    .distinctUntilChanged(state => state.loggedIn)\n    .filter(state => state.loggedIn);\n\n  // Redirect on login!\n  const redirect$ = didLogin$\n    .withLatestFrom(\n      transitionTo$,\n      // Use query parameter as redirect path\n      (state, transitionTo) => () => transitionTo(state.router.query.redirect || '/')\n    )\n    .do(go => go());\n\n  return combineLatest(\n    props$, actionCreators$, redirect$,\n    (props, actionCreators) => ({\n      ...props,\n      ...actionCreators\n    });\n});\n```\n\nA more complete example is forthcoming.\n",
